# IT management tools for the social economy

We are a young IT cooperative aiming at providing IT management tools and
services to social economy actors for a sustainable budget.

How ? We provide tailored-made solutions for your business using Odoo Community,
 an open source management software. We offer operational support during and
 after the development as well as training to allow you to manage the tools
 yourself.
